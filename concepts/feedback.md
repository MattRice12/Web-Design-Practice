- I like the UX around the text area, the countdown timer is a nice touch.
- How would you go about making this application more accessible those with physical disabilities or who are visually impaired? What changes would need to be made and what are the best practices in Rails and Jquery for using Aria attributes?
- Along similar lines, how much work would be involved to adapt this app for internationalization?
- Logic that holds the "rules" of all text entries must be between 5 and 500 characters could be abstracted and made more explicit. Right now its spread out to a lot of places.
- There is a comments folder with a form in it?
- There are several empty test files that should just be deleted.
- Overall very good.
