## Accessibility Ideas:

# ARIA attributes
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA

  The Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification from the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative, provides a way to add the missing semantics needed by assistive technologies such as screen readers.

  ARIA provides a means to make web applications and widgets more accessible to a diverse range of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers or magnifiers.

  ARIA is only made available to assistive technology APIs, and doesn't affect native browser functionality with respect to the DOM or styling.
